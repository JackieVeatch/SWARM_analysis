# SWARM_analysis

Analysis of data created in phytoplankton patch definition (see SWARM_ACROBAT repo)

See chapter1_patchID_README.docx for step by step instructions on how the analysis was performed.

two versions: '5m' denoted the version that defines phytoplankton patches by integrating to a constant 5m depth, the other integrating to that profile's mixed layer depth.

compare_real_to_random scripts are not very clean, reach out to jveatch@marine.rutgers.edu with questions.
